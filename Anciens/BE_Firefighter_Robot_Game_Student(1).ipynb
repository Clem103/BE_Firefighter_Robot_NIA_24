    "### Recall: the POMDP model\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's recall that a POMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) is a tuple $\\langle S, A, \\Omega, p(), o(), r(), b_0 \\rangle$, with $S$ (resp. $A$, $\\Omega$) the state (resp. action, observation) space.\n",
    "How does this probabilistic planning model work?\n",
    "1. At each time step $t \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the artificial agent has only a partial knowledge of the actual current state $s \\in S$. In order to still be able to reason about the state of the system, the agent maintains a probability distribution over $S$, called belief state, and denoted by $b_t$. The initial belief state is $b_0$ and takes part in the definition of the POMDP as a prior distribution about the initial state.\n",
    "2. When the artificial agent selects an action $a \\in A$, the probability that the state of the system switches from $s \\in S$ to $s' \\in S$, is $Pr(s'\\mid s,a) = p(s,a,s')$ given by the transition probability function $p()$ in the POMDP definition.\n",
    "3. The current state is not available to the artificial agent, but the latter still receives information given by the observation $o' \\in \\Omega$. The probability that the observation $o' \\in \\Omega$ is received, is $Pr(o'\\mid s',a) = o(a,s',o')$ given by the observation probability function $o()$. \n",
    "4. An action $a$ applied in a state $s$ is rewarded by $r(s,a) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ given by the reward function $r()$.\n",

    "#### The belief state:\n",
    "1. In partially observable domains, only successive actions and observations are visible to the agent to implement the state estimation. These sequences can be seen as the agent's memory.\n",
    "2. Let's define the history of all observations received and actions performed at time step $t \\in \\mathbb{N}$: $h_t := \\{a_0, o_1,...,o_{t-1},a_{t-1},o_t\\}$. The size of the history grows with the time step $t \\in \\mathbb{N}$, so it can become huge very quickly.\n",
    "3. The definition of the belief state at time step $t \\in \\mathbb{N}$ is the probability of the current state $s_t \\in S$ given the history $h_t$: $b_t(s) = Pr(s_t = s \\mid h_t)$.\n",
    "\n",

    "The belief update function $U$ can be defined using transition and observation functions $p()$ and $o()$. When the artificial agent uses action $a_t$ and receives observation $o_{t+1}$, it can use $b_{t+1} = U(a_t,o_{t+1},b_t)$ as belief on the system state $s_{t+1}$. Now, if the belief state is $b_t$, and the selected action is $a_t$, the probability of obtaining the belief state $b_{t+1} = U(b_t,a_t,o_{t+1})$ is the following:\n",

As a result, a POMDP can be transformed into a belief state MDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the artificial agent synthesizes all available information from the past using a belief state $b_t(s)$, which is a probability distribution on the system state updated every time step: $b_t(s) := Pr(s_t=s|o_t,a_{t-1},o_{t-1},..., a_0) = U(a_{t-1},o_t,b_{t-1})(s)$."

Note that this last mental state encapsulates disengaged and over-engaged cases, in which participants performed badly.\n",
